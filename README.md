# 🧠 Urban Intelligence Lab

> “Where Business Intelligence meets Machine Learning for urban systems.”

Urban Intelligence Lab is the unified evolution of two complementary projects —  
**Subte-Dashboard** (urban BI platform) and **AI-Automation Workflow** (AI-based automation pipeline).  
It combines analytics, automation, and AI models into one living portfolio project focused on **urban systems** such as public transport, mobility, and energy.

---

## 🌆 Overview

- **Objective:** create an open, modular laboratory where Business Intelligence meets Machine Learning.  
- **Context:** the project merges real open data from Buenos Aires with AI-driven insights.  
- **Focus Areas:** analytics, automation, and prediction applied to real-world city data.  
- **Data Sources:** open datasets from Buenos Aires Subte (metro system).

## 📊 Datasets Used

| File | Description | Source |
|------|--------------|--------|
| `molinetes_2024_clean.parquet` | Passengers by line | Subte open data |
| `freq_from_form_2024.csv` | Monthly dispatched trains | Derived from Subte data |
| `formaciones_2024.parquet` | Daily train formations | Subte open data |
| `headway_estimates_2024.csv` | Estimated headway (min) | Generated via ETL script |

---

## ⚙️ ETL and Processing

**Headway estimation formula:**

avg_headway_min = (OPERATING_MIN_PER_DAY * days_in_month) / dispatched_trains

OPERATING_MIN_PER_DAY = 1080 (18 operational hours)

Derived in scripts/etl_headway_from_formaciones.py

Output → data/processed/headway_estimates_2024.csv

python scripts/etl_headway_from_formaciones.py

---

## 🚀 Status

**Week 1 – Unified Foundations:**  
Repository initialized, structure defined, and data integration in progress.


## 🗂 Data Layout & Sourcing

- Place **real open datasets** under `data/processed/`:
  - `molinetes_2024_clean.parquet` → passengers by line
  - `freq_from_form_2024.csv` or `formaciones_2024.parquet` → average headway (min)
- The app auto-detects columns with a small heuristic. If a metric is missing, it falls back to **DEMO**.
- Generate a tiny, consistent demo dataset anytime:
  python scripts/prepare_demo_data.py

## ▶️ Run (Local)

# activate venv, then:
python app/main_dashboard.py
# open http://127.0.0.1:8050

## 🧪 Headway Estimates (Week 1)

We don’t have native headway fields in source data, so we derive **avg_headway_min** using a transparent proxy:

- From `freq_from_form_2024.csv` (monthly): `avg_headway_min = (OPERATING_MIN_PER_DAY * days_in_month) / dispatched_trains`
- Fallback: from `formaciones_2024.parquet` (daily → monthly aggregation)

Assumptions:
- `OPERATING_MIN_PER_DAY = 1080` (18h/day). Adjust in `scripts/etl_headway_from_formaciones.py`.

## 🚀 Week 1 – Unified Foundations

Highlights:

Created base repository and folder structure

Connected real passenger and service datasets

Built first Dash visualization

Derived and visualized Average Headway (min)

Generated reproducible screenshot assets

Next Steps (Weeks 2–3):

Integrate AI-driven insights via Streamlit + Ollama

Automate ETL and dashboard updates via n8n

Expand data sources (GTFS, climate, mobility)

---

## 🧠 Week 2 – AI Integration & Headway Calibration

**Objective:**  
Connect Urban Intelligence Lab’s analytical layer with an AI-driven insight module and calibrated operational metrics.

**Key Milestones**
- 🔗 Connected Dash & Streamlit for unified analytics  
- 🧮 Developed ETL for *headway estimation* from train dispatch data  
- ⚖️ Applied automatic calibration (median ≈ 3.5 min headway)  
- 🧠 Integrated local LLM (Ollama) to generate weekly insight reports  
- 🚉 Added Premetro (P) support to extend coverage beyond Subte lines  
- 🧹 Implemented cache invalidation + auto-cleanup for generated reports  

**Output Artifacts**
- `data/processed/headway_estimates_2024.csv` (calibrated)
- `app/insights_streamlit.py` (AI Insights interface)
- `assets/reports/week2_insights_*.md` (weekly AI summaries)

**Preview**
> Dashboard now combines passenger data, calibrated service headways, and automated AI summaries generated locally via Ollama — a solid foundation for upcoming predictive modules.

---

## 🧭 Week 3 – Forecasting & Automation

This week’s focus was on **predictive analytics and workflow automation**.

### 🚀 New Features
- Implemented **4-week passenger forecasting** (Prophet-based pipeline).
- Integrated **n8n webhook automation** directly from Streamlit.
- Added **Premetro (P)** line to analytics.
- Kept **Ollama** as the default AI summarizer (no external API keys required).
