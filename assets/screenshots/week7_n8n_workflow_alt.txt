Screenshot of an n8n workflow from the Urban Intelligence Lab project. The flow starts with a manual trigger, then an Edit Fields node that sets a sample incident description, a JavaScript “Build Prompt” node, an HTTP “Call Ollama” node that queries a local LLM model, and a “Parse Classification” code node that converts the LLM response into structured JSON.
